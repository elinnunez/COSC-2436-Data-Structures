shortest path: https://structy.net/problems/shortest-path
Write a function, shortestPath, that takes in a vector of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1.
