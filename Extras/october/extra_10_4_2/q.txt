find a palindrome using a stack or queue
-Do these steps simultaneously:
       Read >> Push into stack
       Read >> enqueue into queue
Once full pop from the stack and dequeue from the queue, and then compare these two letters.
Once they are not equal you will stop comparing and return false. (In this case they are not equal therefore the input is not a palindrome).
